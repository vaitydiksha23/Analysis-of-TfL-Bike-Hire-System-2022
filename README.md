Analysis of TfL's Bike Hire System, Santander Cycles 

This project was done during my masters at King's College London in 2022

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the bike hire data from 1st January 2022 to 30th June 2022. 
This included the study and visualisation of monthly, weekly, and daily rental counts along with the Origin-Destination (OD) matrix for all the docking stations in London. 
The most and least used stations were also analysed and compared. Density maps displayed the variations in arrivals and departures throughout the day, as well as the paths taken by individual bike trips. 
A stochastic simulation using Poisson distribution was employed to estimate the negative customer experience to understand how the bike inventory level can affect the user experience. 
Python programming language and Microsoft Visual Studio Code was used for all the analysis and visualisation.

Docking stations- An interactive map showing the locations of the available docking stations for the Santander Cycles. This map displays all the docking points along with its information containing station ID, station capacity and station name in a cluster. Any station with a capacity of less than 15 is marked with a red circle, a capacity between 15 to 30 is marked with an orange circle, and the remaining stations with a capacity of over 30 are marked with a green circle.
